# grid-intensity-go

A tool written in Go, designed to be integrated into Kubernetes, Nomad, and other schedulers, to help you factor carbon intensity into decisions about where and when to run jobs.

The tool has 3 components.

- The `grid-intensity` CLI for interacting with carbon intensity data.
- A [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) exporter with carbon intensity metrics that can be deployed via
Docker, Nomad, or Kubernetes.
- A Go library that can be integrated into your Go code.

## Background

We know that the internet runs on electricity. That electricity comes from a mix of energy sources, including wind and solar, nuclear power, biomass, fossil gas, oil and coal and so on,

We call this the fuel mix, and this fuel mix can impact on the carbon intensity of your code.

## Move your code through time and space

Because the fuel mix will be different depending when and where you run your code, you can influence the carbon intensity of the code you write by moving it through time and space - either by making it run when the grid is greener, or making it run where it's greener, like a CDN running on green power.

## Inspired By

This tool builds on research and tools developed from across the sustainable software community.

## Installing

- Install via [brew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
brew install thegreenwebfoundation/carbon-aware-tools/grid-intensity
```

- Install via curl (feel free to do due diligence and check the [script](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/grid-intensity-go/blob/main/install.sh) first).

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thegreenwebfoundation/grid-intensity-go/install-script/install.sh | sudo sh
```

- Fetch a binary release from the [releases](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/grid-intensity-go/releases) page.

## grid-intensity CLI

The CLI allows you to interact with carbon intensity data from multiple providers.

```sh
$ grid-intensity
Provider ember-climate.org needs an ISO country code as a region parameter.
ESP detected from your locale.
ESP
{
	"country_code_iso_2": "ES",
	"country_code_iso_3": "ESP",
	"country_or_region": "Spain",
	"year": 2021,
	"latest_year": 2021,
	"emissions_intensity_gco2_per_kwh": 193.737
}
```

The `--provider` and `--region` flags allow you to select other providers and regions.
You can also set the `GRID_INTENSITY_PROVIDER` and `GRID_INTENSITY_REGION` environment
variables or edit the config file at `~/.config/grid-intensity/config.yaml`.

```sh
$ grid-intensity --provider carbonintensity.org.uk --region UK
{
	"from": "2022-07-14T14:30Z",
	"to": "2022-07-14T15:00Z",
	"intensity": {
		"forecast": 184,
		"actual": 194,
		"index": "moderate"
	}
}
```

The [providers](#providers) section shows how to configure other providers.

## grid-intensity exporter

The `exporter` subcommand starts the prometheus exporter on port 8000.

```sh
$ grid-intensity exporter --provider ember-climate.org --region FR
Using provider "ember-climate.org" with region "FR"
Metrics available at :8000/metrics
```

View the metrics with curl.

```
$ curl -s http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep grid
# HELP grid_intensity_carbon_average Average carbon intensity for the electricity grid in this region.
# TYPE grid_intensity_carbon_average gauge
grid_intensity_carbon_average{provider="ember-climate.org",region="FR",units="gCO2 per kWh"} 67.781
```

### Docker Image

Build the docker image to deploy the exporter.

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o grid-intensity .
docker build -t thegreenwebfoundation/grid-intensity:latest .
```

### Kubernetes

Install the [helm](https://helm.sh/) chart in [/helm/grid-intensity-exporter](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/grid-intensity-go/tree/main/helm/grid-intensity-exporter).
Needs the Docker image to be available in the cluster.

```sh
helm install --set gridIntensity.region=FR grid-intensity-exporter helm/grid-intensity-exporter
```

### Nomad

Edit the Nomad job in [/nomad/grid-intensity-exporter.nomad](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/grid-intensity-go/blob/main/nomad/grid-intensity-exporter.nomad) to set the
env vars `GRID_INTENSITY_REGION` and `GRID_INTENSITY_PROVIDER`

Start the Nomad job. Needs the Docker image to be available in the cluster.

```sh
nomad run ./nomad/grid-intensity-exporter.nomad
```

## grid-intensity-go library

See the [/examples/](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/grid-intensity-go/tree/main/examples) 
directory for examples of how to integrate each provider.

## Providers

Currently these providers of carbon intensity data are integrated. If you would like
us to integrate more providers please open an [issue](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/grid-intensity-go/issues).

### CarbonIntensity.org.uk

UK Carbon Intensity API https://carbonintensity.org.uk/ this is a public API
and the only region supported is `UK`.

```sh
grid-intensity --provider=carbonintensity.org.uk --region=UK
```

### ElectricityMap.org

[Electricity Map](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map) have carbon intensity data
from multiple sources. You need an [API token](https://static.electricitymap.org/api/docs/index.html#authentication)
to use the API.

The `region` parameter needs to be set to a zone present in the public [zones](https://static.electricitymap.org/api/docs/index.html#zones) endpoint.

```sh
ELECTRICITY_MAP_API_TOKEN=your-token \
grid-intensity --provider=electricitymap.org --region=IN-KA
```

### Ember-Climate.org

Carbon intensity data from [Ember](https://ember-climate.org/), is embedded in the binary
in accordance with their licensing - [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://ember-climate.org/creative-commons/)

```sh
grid-intensity --provider=ember-climate.org --region=DE
```

The `region` parameter should be set to a 2 or 3 char ISO country code.

### WattTime.org

[WattTime](https://www.watttime.org/) have carbon intensity data from multiple sources.
You need to [register](https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/#authentication) to use the API.

The `region` parameter should be set to a supported region. The `/ba-from-loc`
endpoint allows you to provide a latitude and longitude. See the [docs](https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/#determine-grid-region) for more details.


```sh
WATT_TIME_USER=your-user \
WATT_TIME_PASSWORD=your-password \
grid-intensity --provider=watttime.org --region=CAISO_NORTH
```
